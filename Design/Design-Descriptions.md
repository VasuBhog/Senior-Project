# Design Description 

### Diagram 1: 
* High-Level Design of the Input Layer, Computer Layer, and Output Layer.
* Able to illustrate the overall system design that will take place.
* Includes the amount of data, computation through ML models and output to the interface.

### Diagram 2: 
* A more concrete diagram illustrating from the user perspective. 
* Illustrates the computer layer further.
* We will feed live feed road data into our image processing program that will be able to detect and use the ML models to output warnings to the user.

### Diagram 3: 
* An in-depth look at the internal system of the ML models and Computer Vision. 
* The diagram will illustrate what the user should get back to the interface based on the computer layer.
* The diagram illustrates the different components of the machine learning model that will be used to first learn and then process the live feed data back to the user.
